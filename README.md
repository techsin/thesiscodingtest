Design to code


1. If I could use JS, I'd implement menu as a full page popup for mobile version and sliding menu for desktop version.
2. In mobile version I'd include the center menu in the right menu as well, sepearted by dividers. 
3. Menu would have x symbol for mobile version and slide detection to close it up for dekstop, both would have click/touch outside to close.
4. Font given wasn't the font used.
5. I'd have made copy little better or added more section. Right now it's vague what the landing page is actually about.
6. I'd add a video explainer about the product. 
7. I'd remove the right menu in desktop version, user isn't even logged in how could there be so many options available. I'd reduce font size and move center menu to in place of right menu. 
8. I find design to be great otherwise.
